## 🌱 About Me

I'm a B.Sc. IT graduate with a passion for crafting clean, user-friendly web applications. I enjoy working across the full stack, turning ideas into functional products. One of my recent projects is [Asset Manager](https://github.com/codebyhema/Asset_Manager), a platform designed to help individuals manage their assets efficiently.

When I'm not immersed in code, I enjoy exploring new technologies, reading tech blogs, or unwinding with a good book or movie. I believe in continuous learning and am always eager to take on new challenges that help me grow as a developer.
